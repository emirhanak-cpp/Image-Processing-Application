# Image-Processing-Application
An application that lets you manipulate the pixels of an image. You can also apply certain filters and run edge detection algorithms. After you're finished with your work you can save the image on to your PC.
In this reporsitory I included the necessarry .py files that controls all of the file handling, and image processing functions. The overall UI of the app that was done with QtDesigner and it is also included.
In order to run the file you just need to execute the driver.
In the final release of the application example images and doxygen documentation is also included.
